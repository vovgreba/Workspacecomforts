              Understanding Marketing ROI
            </h2>

            <p>
              At its core, marketing ROI is a measure of the revenue generated from marketing activities relative to the
              cost of those
              activities. However, calculating ROI in the realm of marketing can be complex due to the multifaceted
              nature of
              marketing campaigns and the various touchpoints involved in the customer journey. To accurately measure
              ROI, businesses
              must consider a range of metrics that capture different aspects of marketing performance.

                  Key Metrics for Measuring Marketing ROI

                    <h3>
                      Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      CAC measures the cost associated with acquiring a new customer. By dividing the total marketing
                      spend by the number of
                      new customers acquired within a specific time frame, businesses can determine the
                      cost-effectiveness of their customer
                      acquisition efforts
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      CLV represents the total revenue generated from a customer over the entire duration of their
                      relationship with the
                      business. Comparing CLV to CAC provides insights into the long-term profitability of acquiring and
                      retaining customers

                    <p>
                      Conversion rates measure the percentage of website visitors or leads that take a desired action,
                      such as making a
                      purchase or filling out a form. Analyzing conversion rates helps businesses understand the
                      effectiveness of their
                      marketing campaigns in driving desired outcomes

                    <p>
                      Attribution models attribute credit to different marketing channels and touchpoints along the
                      customer journey. By
                      assigning value to each interaction, businesses can gain insights into the contribution of various
                      marketing efforts to
